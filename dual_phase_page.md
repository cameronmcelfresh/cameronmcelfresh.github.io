## Project Overview

**Summary:** Titanium's high strength-to-weight ratio makes it an ideal candidate for certain types of lightweight armor, though it's inherent brittleness often disqualifies it for many applications. We are developing a method for optimizing the Titanium's phase distribution and microstructure in high-strain rate environments.
