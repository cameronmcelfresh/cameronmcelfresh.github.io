## Project Overview

**Summary:** In conjunction with <a href="http://www.maass.nu">Robert Maass's research group</a>Dr.  at University of Illonois Urbana Champange, we are investigating temperature-dependent dislocation avalanche behavior. Using the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/model/model/wiki/Home">Mechanics of Defect Evolution Library (MODEL)</a> , plasticity is modeled with an array dislocation compositions, temperature, and strain rate to invstigate avalanche tendencies.
