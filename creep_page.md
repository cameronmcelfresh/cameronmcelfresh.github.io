## Project Overview

**Summary:** <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creep_(deformation)">Creep deformation</a> is a prominent issue when high-performance devices are operating at elevated temperatures for long lifetimes. We took a discrete approach to studying vacancy-mediated creep, and developed a drift-diffusion <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_Monte_Carlo">kinetic Monte Carlo</a> Model to operate on top of a traditional dislocation dynamics library <a href="https://bitbucket.org/model/model/wiki/Home">(MODEL)</a>. We explore the effects of elevated vacancy concentrations, pressure, and temperature on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation#Climb">climb</a> characteristics.
