## Project Overview

**Summary:** While working in <a href="http://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/faculty/faculty_bios/index.sfe?fmp_recid=156">Dr. Kenneth Vecchio's</a> research group, many of our projects involved sintering complex metallic and ceramic materials. Alongside traditional XRD databases, we developed a simple program to simulate single phase materials.
