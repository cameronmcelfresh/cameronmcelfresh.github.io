## Research

---
My research has touched on a number of areas, ranging from simulation of high-temperature creep in nanopillars to design and fabrication of a submerged spark-discharge apparatus. My recent publications. 

At UCLA I am focused on developing computational methods to simulate material plasticity in environments that are difficult (or impossible) to experimentally observe - including [high-temperature creep](/creep_page), [dislocation avalanches](/avalanche_page), and [high-strain rate deformation](/sample_page). 


I also have a number of side projects that keep me busy.
