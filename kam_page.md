## Project Overview

**Summary:** The large amount of data extracted during electron backscatter diffraction can be mined for detailed microstructural mapping. Along with basic crystallography and phase information, misorientation mapping can provide information about subgrain strain and even geometriclly necessary dislocation distributions. A tool was developed to post-process EBSD patterns in order to investigate subgrain misorientation.
